== About


== Installation
    
    gem install ganeti_client


== Usage
    
    # Create a client instance
    client = GanetiClient::Client.new("host:port", "username", "password")

    # now you should be able to access the api resources by using the client instance. 
    # example:
    info = client.info_get
    => #<GanetiInfo:0x10151bb78>

    # most methods return an object. When you use .to_json on an object, you get 
    # the json object returned
    # then you can see all the attributes available
    info.name
    => "hostname"
